# planner

In this project, you must first implement a general purpose Planner. Then, model the desired ranges
and run your Planner on issues related to these domains.
● Implementation of Planner
In this part of the project, the requested items are:
Backward State-space Search ● Implementation
Forward State-space Search ● Implementation
Ignore Preconditions ● Heuristic implementation
● Ignore Delete Lists heuristic implementation
Note that the two heuristics mentioned are only requested for Forward State-space Search.
In addition, the implementation and application of these two heuristics are considered separately. When solving a data problem
Done, your Planner should print a sequence of actions as output. Also, it is time to solve a problem
Calculated by your program and finally printed

● Requested domains
After implementing the general-purpose Planner in the previous section, model the following domains and your Planner
Run in both Forward and Backward directions on your modeling of these domains. Modes and
The actions in your modeling must follow the rules of the PDDL language.
Spare Tire Domain:

Blocks World domain:
To review the domain, refer to Blocks World and the course reference book. (Third edition, page 370).
4th edition, page 364. Note that the number of blocks is not necessarily equal to 3.
Monkey and Bananas domain:

Domain (Link-repeat):
In this domain, every action is defined as follows:
